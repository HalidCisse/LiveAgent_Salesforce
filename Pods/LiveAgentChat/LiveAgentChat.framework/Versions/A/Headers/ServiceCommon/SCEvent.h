/**
 Class used to represent events which are influenced by a user, or that may influence a user interface.
 
 @discussion
 The properties on these objects are readonly and are intended for informational purposes.  New intents
 of these events can be created by assigning different `name` values that have special meanings.  For example,
 SalesforceChatter uses these to describe user actions performed on the feed, such as taping a "Like" button or
 tapping on a feed item itself.  The result of such an action is determined by the consumer of these events.
