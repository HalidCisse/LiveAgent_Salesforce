/** Returns a localized string with the given key, and the supplied table.
 
 The keys used in here may be overridden by a host application; the key in this case is prepended with the string "ServiceCloud." and the main bundle's default localization table is searched.  If a localization is supplied for that matching key, the result is returned.  Otherwise the localization falls back to the framework-supplied localization within the indicated table.

 @warning This method should not be used directly, but should rather be accessed using a table-specific macro allowing the `genstrings` command to easily identify uses of localizable strings.
 @param key   Localizable key.
 @param table Table to use, or `nil` if the default table should be used.  Within Service Cloud, this value should always be supplied.
 @return Localized string.
